# Learning as a generative activity

I read this book from scholars few years ago https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/learning-as-a-generative-activity/A7E1D7F80C8078AF9E4418ABFF459589.
The title is "Learning as a Generative Activity"
It was a great resource, that deserved to be more known.

But since chatGPT, it comes very often to my mind.
Because the theory of the authors seemingly go in the opposite direction of the usage of generative AI for learning.
Because if we outsource the generative work to the AI, well, we might lose something important.

This is already an issue with students using AI to make it write their homework.
In my field of work, I see posts on reddit that juniors developpers understand and learn less at their job.

Of course, the whole project takes a different stance, generative AI can be used to promote more generative activities from the students, not less.
Let us never underestimate the importance of staying involved in the production of flashcards, concept maps, mind maps and summaries.

co-generative activities might be a totally valid, even more powerful learning experience than classical generative activities.

There is potential for reforming the homework format, asking full or partial traces of these interactions. The raison d'Ãªtre of homeworks is fostering learning, so if co-generative activities are more pleasant and more powerful than generative activities, then it should be an important path to explore for educative inovations.
