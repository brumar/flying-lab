# vision about learning

v0, poorly written given how this is important to me, but you will get the idea. Done is better than perfect.

Learners need to be strong and independent. Tools and techniques exist and provide large benefits and a sense of growth that is invaluable and is there to stay for life.
This vision has been adversely reinforced during my 6 years in postgraduate studies and my work in the private sector in the domain of educative technologies.
"How to transmit this knowledge as best as possible" is what most of educators, technologist and researchers in this field have in mind.
But what is in the mind of the student is rather: "How to learn my course material as best as possible".
This is not the same viewpoint. 
One pet peeve of mine was to ask technologist or researchers I met if they knew about the anki software, which is a major tool of choice for serious learners. I remember about only two positive answers (but one was from an expert of spaced repetition, hopefully it does not count :) ). Teachers and even scientists, however, know quite well some of the most popular quizzing application that can take place in the classroom.


Efforts on how to improve general learning abilities is under-studied and under-appreciated. 
I want to see more and more technologist and researchers willing to talk to students first, and educators second.
Past 12 years, children are not children anymore, the focus of educators should be to make them more and more independant of school settings over time.
This is a social subject too, having student's success depending on the quality of educational approaches make them more subject to social injustice, or just sheer bad luck.

Technology just made an impressive jump forward, let's ride this wave with idea of empowerement at heart.


## But research did tackle the subject of studying!

Sure, but from the classroom spirit in mind.

In the tremendously famous study of Dunlosky & al (2010), comparing learning techniques, an important criterion for the author is the compatibility with the classroom settings. Yet students generally study outside the classroom settings. Another criterion is the amount of training required. But, is this fair ? We have a whole life to do this amazing activity: learning new things, so why not invest a bit of time in training learning techniques. Why do I fixate over this study? Because it's one of the most interesting review on the subject. And yet, boundaries of these lines of research make it rather clear that the focus is on the teaching side of matter, not the studying side. I read this review multiple times, each time with tons of excitation and frustration. I mean no reproach to anyone, my point is just that: the field of self-learning or self-studying (dramatic choice of words) is only at its infancy. Please prove me wrong.

Anyway, I think I am rambling and this repository is not about academia.
