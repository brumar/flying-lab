# INTRODUCTION

## tl;dr

Most probably, **my prompts collection and experimentations** is the most interesting part of this repository. 

So just go there: [prompts/myprompts/](prompts/myprompts/) and maybe there [experimentations/brumar/favorites](experimentations/brumar/favorites).

## But what am I looking at?

This is me sharing stuff about llms for studying, probably other things too. This is an experimental repository. 

**My goal is to help learners who wants to tap into the power of generative AI to leverage (or learn?) efficient learning techniques**

My angle is really the learner eye, not the teaching eye. The learning material may be a bit raw, the targeted outcomes and the learning strategy are determined and implemented by the learner. 

From a product perspective, I have tons of ideas, but in the spirit of the "user first" perspective, I'll let experimentations decide for me the best course of action.

I need to not overthink it to avoid loosing momentum, and rather cultivate its lively mess and a bit of crazyness.

# HOW THIS REPOSITORY IS ORGANIZED

For the moment, it's highly focused on the usage of LLMS for learners.

- [curation](curation/): not much for the moment. I intend to share links, sometimes with comments, with a strong focus on the subject of prompts for learners.
- [experimentations](experimentations/): nothing yet. I publish most of my trial and errors using a pdf format. It's worth noting that some parts are vocal conversations with chatgpt4o.
- [prompts/myprompts](prompts/myprompts/): The prompts I am working on
- [prompts/otherprompts](prompts/otherprompts/): not much yet. The prompt from external sources
- [ideas-roadmap](ideas-roadmap/): what it's currently in my head for the future
- [src](src/): for code and stuff
- [thoughts-articles](thoughts-articles/): Probably just rambling.

# CONTACT

Shout me a mail at martin.bruno.mail@gmail.com
Subjects I'd love:

- "Hey! look at this awesome/terrible interaction I had with chatGPT / claude.". Hint: use a web browser plugin to export as pdf or send me the json export directly.
- "I'd love that you go into <<this>> direction"
- "I used a modified version of a prompt for the better"
- "Look at that! That might interest you."
- "I can find you money if you build cool stuff."
- "I have a spot for you in Paris so that you can help and iterate with real students."

I am french, so french people can do too that but in french.

# Who am I ?

Someone with a strong passion for learning techniques since they basically saved my ass 15 years ago.

I did an engineering school followed by a Phd in cognitive sciences and worked for edtech companies for 8 years as a tech guy.

In the mean time I attended some memory competitions, co-organized a meetup about learning how to learn and engaged with the anki community, and launched some side projects related to this field.

Here are the techniques I love: concept mapping, mind mapping, spaced repetition, Free Recall, Method of Loci. Hopefully others in the future :)

I am convinced that a mastery of these techniques and a knowledge on their strength and weaknesses can turn a learner in a stronger and happier learner.

I take as hypothesis that LLMs can provide strong support for learning and using these techniques. More on what's in my mind in the ideas and thoughts folder.
