# AI-Powered Learning Techniques Repository

## TL;DR

Most probably, **my prompts collection and experimentations** is the most interesting part of this repository.
Check it out here: [prompts/myprompts/](prompts/myprompts/).

There is no guide yet not custom GPT, so take a prompt that piques your interest and copy it in your favorite LLM chat interface.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to sharing and experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient learning techniques. The goal is to help learners harness the power of generative AI to enhance their learning strategies.

## What Is This Project?

This repository is an experimental platform focused on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced learning experiences.
Key aspects include: 

* Resources about LLMs for studying
* Prompts and experiments for leveraging AI in learning
* Ideas and thoughts on the intersection of AI and learning techniques

My perspective is that of a learner, not a teacher. The learning material may be raw, with targeted outcomes and learning strategies determined by the learner.

### Project Philosophy

* User-first approach: Let experiments guide the project's direction
* Embrace the "lively mess" and creativity
* Focus on practical applications for learners

## Who am I?

I'm a passionate advocate for effective learning techniques, with a background that includes:

- Engineering degree and Ph.D. in cognitive sciences, followed by 8 years in EdTech as a tech professional
- Active community engagement through memory competitions, open source toolings, and co-organizing a "learning how to learn" meetup in Paris

My vision is that new technologies can now provide a robust support for a more joyful and efficient learn-at-home experience for students and lifelong learners alike.
