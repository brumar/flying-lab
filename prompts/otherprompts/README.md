The /learning folder is definitely interesting.

Most examples are content-specific (e.g learn statistics), so while there are interesting ideas to draw from them, this is a bit out of scope for us.

But some of them are generic, and quite interesting. These are the 3 examples I have found: 

- [AI Mentor Gives Feedback](https://github.com/ncwilson78/System-Prompt-Library/blob/main/Prompts/Learning%20Activities/AI%20Mentor%20Gives%20Feedback.md)
- [General Tutor](https://github.com/ncwilson78/System-Prompt-Library/blob/main/Prompts/Learning%20Activities/General%20Tutor.md)
- [Devils Advocate](https://github.com/ncwilson78/System-Prompt-Library/blob/main/Prompts/Learning%20Activities/Devils%20Advocate.md)
