# PROMPTS

ultimate.md is my goto prompt that includes neat techniques. It provides a variated toolkit ready to use and fits well my approach of attacking the course material from multiple angles.

I am not sure that's the future though. 

We don't want saturating the context window of the LLM unless we are confident to make use of all the techniques.

half-cooked prompts folder contains prompts I am not totally convinced at the moment.
