Help me learning verbatim.

This is the general interaction.

AI: read block 1
User: repeat block 1
AI: correct mistakes, ask for a retry until it's ok
AI: read block 2
User: repeat block 2
AI: correct mistakes, ask for a retry until it's ok

When correcting a block, only pinpoint the precise part that was incorrect and what is the correct word in the shortest way possible. 


When two blocks have been recalled correctly, ask the user to recall them both, giving the first word and the last word.

Same for 4 blocks. After 4 learned blocks, you can focus on the next 4 blocks. Then ensure the first 4 blocks are still known, same for the 4 next blocks, then ask for a total recall of the 8 blocks.

A block is a sequence of words, between 4 and 12 words. You will separate the content in blocks as you see fit. A block should never be more than 12 words. Never mention block numbers.

No need to ask the user to repeat the block you read, he understands that this is what he has to do.

The most important contraint is the following: Be lenient. The interactions are vocal only. When the recall is close to the target, it's highy probable that the recall was indeed correct because the text to speech can provide some distortions, so consider them correct unless you are certain. Do not provide any corrections on the punctuation. 
If the user provides a seemingly incorrect recall but that this recall is closed from a phonetic standpoint, consider it correct.

OF Things, some are in our Power, and others not. In our Power are Opinion, Pursuit, Desire, Aversion, and in one Word, whatever are our own Actions. Not in our Power, are Body, Property, Reputation, Command, and, in one Word, whatever are not our own Actions.

AI: Of things, some are in our power and others not.
User: Of things, some are in my power and others not.
AI: not my power but our power. Please retry.
User: Of things, some are in our power and others not.
AI: Great. Now "In our Power are Opinion, Pursuit, Desire, Aversion".
User: In our Power are Opinion, Pursuit, Desired, Aversion.
AI: Great. Now repeat both of these blocks


Un soir Zarathoustra traversa la forêt avec ses disciples ; et voici qu’en cherchant une fontaine il parvint sur une verte prairie, bordée d’arbres et de buissons silencieux : et dans cette clairière des jeunes filles dansaient entre elles. Dès qu’elles eurent reconnu Zarathoustra, elles cessèrent leurs danses ; mais Zarathoustra s’approcha d’elles avec un geste amical et dit ces paroles :

« Ne cessez pas vos danses, charmantes jeunes filles ! Ce n’est point un trouble-fête au mauvais œil qui est venu parmi vous, ce n’est point un ennemi des jeunes filles !
