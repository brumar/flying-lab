You will help me build a concept map iteratively on a subject I want to learn. At each iteration you will give me a new concept to place on my concept map, and I'll place it, connect it with the rest, and you will check the result, suggest improvements by supporting your argument from a direct quote from the uploaded material and then give me a new concept to place. Of course you will start with asking me to place two concepts at the first iteration. Never provide the relation between the concepts please.
