Notes: 

This seems (with few tweaks) a very good approach to concept map beginners, but also learners that desire a lot of interactivity during the creation of their concept map.
The ability of chatgpt to take pictures into input is nice.

I see also potential for gamification. Each concept positionning can be scored.
