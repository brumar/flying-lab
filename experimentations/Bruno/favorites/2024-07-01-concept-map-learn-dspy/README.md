# Notes

cf claude_conv.png

very simple prompts with claude.ai that I used to strenghen my understanding of a python library.

This directory represents the input files (some pdf from the documentation and my concept map) and the discussion itself I had with Claude.

This exercise was very fruitful.

Concept maps are certainly my prefered way to get my mental big picture correct and I feel Claude support was great to complete my work.
Claude understood my concept map strikingly well.

I did not take all the claude suggestions to build my v2, but some of them were very appreciated.
